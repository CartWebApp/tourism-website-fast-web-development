            <h3> The Vatican City... a Country? </h3>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vatican City remains one of the most interesting countries in the world. Despite its small size and low population, the unique micro-country doubling as an independent city state is located in Rome; one of the most culturally dense and relevant places in the modern day. Among the traditions persisting to the present, no other is as greatly honored as Easter- well, at least in the case of Vatican City. Within her city walls every year great celebrations take place to praise and revel in the resurrection of Christ. If one were to want to visit the holy city (and by consequence, Rome) they should take note of the following./p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to an April 2021 blogpost on a website solely dedicated to Rome, Romewise lists activities present there as including grand museums featuring works of art, historical sites; the graves of saints, the formidable colosseum, elegant gardens and beautiful structures. Not to mention the traditional Easter meals and specialities. For a Catholic, or anyone curious enough for that matter- the most important part of the Easter visit will be attending the Easter mass. According to a blog article by blueskytraveler the very atmospheric event itself is all in Latin, barring the final blessing which is featured in 65 different languages, and will not be the only mass. During the entire Easter holiday there will be multiple masses, each with their own purpose and reason for being. Considering a trip is unthinkable, as anyone interested would not waste their days pondering such a question when the same time spent could be better used in a week of jubilant celebration over in Rome's holy city.

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vatican City (apart from Catholicism) is well known for fine art and centuries-old timeless works. Romewise notes the following; the holy city's museums are vast and varied, containing works from across the ancient world, but primarily from Rome. In the Vatican's museums lay countless artworks- from detailed and refined statues to intricate tapestry weavings; halls of medieval maps will be found, detailing an accurate and elegant layout of Italy. If one were to visit the musei vaticani site they would take note that among the pictures and buildings, none stand out more than the Sistine Chapel, beautifully painted;  its walls and ceiling were born of Michelangelo's genius mind and time worn hands. The Vatican's museums are often forgotten, but if one were to step into their world they would be consumed by the artistic majesty and mastery before them. </p>
