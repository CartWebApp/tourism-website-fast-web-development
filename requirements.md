# Tourism Website Project

You have been recruited by a travel agent to create a tourism themed website for 18-29 year old humans. The website will feature the important details about the countries (not including the U.S.A.) that your team has chosen (one unique country per student).  


## Project Requirements:


## Content:



* Content should include:
    * A **‘Home**’** **page** **that is visually appealing and features content sections that use images and text to introduce and link to the other pages of your website.
    * A ‘**Destinations**’ page featuring an overview of each country your travel agency offers packages to.
    * Each destination should feature at least 3 pages:
        * An **‘About**’** (e.g. About Fiji) **page featuring the location, demographics, exports, major cities and natural locations, cultural overview, and a brief history of the country. 
        * A **‘Discover**’** (e.g. Discover Fiji) **page featuring the cultural traditions, associated locales, and other notable tourist destinations and activities.
        * A **‘Visit**’** (e.g. Visit Fiji) **page detailing the travel options to the country, lodging options (especially anything culturally or historically significant), and in-country transportation options.
* Each page should have a full-width ‘hero’ image near the top with the page title overlaid (using CSS not Photoshop).
* Each content item should feature multiple paragraphs of information and supporting images.
* Consistent color and font usage that enhances the legibility of your information
* Content should be free of punctuation, grammar, and spelling errors.
* Copyrighted photos must be credited to the author/publisher.
* References to the sites used in your research should be located in the footer of the page(s) the source is used on.


## Technical:



* **A detailed Figma prototype** should be completed **_prior _**to writing **_any_** code.
* **Daily commits **to a shared Github repository by each team member during the programming phase.
* Consistently placed and styled navigation to all pages on each page
    * The current page should not be removed from the navigation but marked as “active” and styled separately through css.
* Valid, semantic HTML/CSS (should pass the [W3C HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/))
    * [Semantic HTML](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html/modules/learn-semantic-html/cheatsheet) uses more than “divs”. It incorporates, but is not limited to, the header, nav, main, section, article, aside, and footer elements to accurately describe the content of the element.
* Multi-column layout using CSS Flexbox
* **One** shared external CSS Stylesheet
* **CSS Media Queries** that enable your website to function well at any screen size. Minimally your site should adapt to:
    * **Desktop **> ~992px wide
    * **Large Tablet **&lt; ~992px wide
    * **Medium Tablet** &lt; ~768px wide
    * **Phone** &lt; ~480px wide
    * These widths are starting points and may vary based on your site layout. Fix your site at each width it “breaks” at.
* Footer including image credits, research citations along with crediting your team and CART.
* No text baked into image(s), you should always type textual information in your editor and overlay it on images with CSS.
