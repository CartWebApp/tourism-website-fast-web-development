            <h2>The Modern Symbol of Ukraine</h2>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Originating from a 12th century Ruthenian flag the modern day Ukrainian flag features a mix of "Strong Azure" (#0057b7) and Yellow (#ffd700). These colors get their historical significance from pre-christian paganism, in which blue and yellow represented water and fire respectively. The flag itself time and time again has fought many battles against unparalled opposition in the form of redesign over redesign coinciding with the flowing change of its nationsfor it's persistence under adversity and pressure it has staked i claim countless times over as the predominant representation of its home country.</p>

        <h2>The Nation of Ukraine</h2>
        <p class="gaming">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ukraine is the 2nd largest country in Europe. The territory that would come to be Ukraine was split between Poland and Russia, but following the Russian Revolution in WW2 and the establishment of the USSR, it became the Ukrainian Peopleâ€™s Republic. Soon after it merged with the Soviet Union, becoming the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. In 1991 Ukraine became independent following the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
        <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Demographically is 77.8% Ukrainian, but there is also a substantial population of Russians at 17.3% of the population. This is mainly attributed to the history of Ukraine as a member of the Soviet Union and as being partially within the territory of The Russian Empire.
